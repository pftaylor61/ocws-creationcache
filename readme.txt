A plugin to facilitate the use of Creation Caches

== Description ==

The Creation Cache Plugin allows the creation and display of Creation Caches, which are like Geocaches(TM) or OpenCaches. I have used the term Creation Cache, but the user can change this in a configuration file to any name they like (ocws-creationcache-config.php). 

Ultimately, this plugin will support the download of .gpx and .loc files for use in GPS equipment (including smartphones).

== Installation ==

1. Unzip `ocws-creationcache.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
OR
2. Upload through the Add New Plugin feature
THEN
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
